 <h3>Star Wars</h3>
 <p>This movie is teling about intergalatic wars between Jedi Order vs Sith Lord, with all that shiny light saber and the action its was perfect, and also they have some serious lore if u watch some sequal.</p>

 <h3>Rick and Morty</h3>
 <p>This animation movie series is telling about Smith Family, who have genius scientist grandpa who can travel through dimension and inventing some sci-fi things, the granpa name is Rick, he also have a grandson named Morty, he help Rick through his adventure.</p>

 <h3>Spongebob Squarepants</h3>
 <p>This cartoon is my childhood memory, the funny yellow sponge with some pants is teling some absurb story but funny, there is nothing serius about the animation, its only funny things happen there.</p>
